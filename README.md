they are traveling in small group. Let’s say, 3 people who want tour
Rajasthan and they are coming from Mumbai. One group of three people
are also going to tour Rajasthan on the same day and they are coming
from Delhi. If their group can be combined in a single group, their traveling
and accommodation expenses can be reduced. One local trained guide
can also be help them to know that place better and can give insights and
>details of each and every part of the space around them.
